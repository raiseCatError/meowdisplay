# App Review — response reference

Reference copy of the text we send to App Review, kept in version control alongside the
listing. Update when the situation changes.

> **Historical record, not current MeowDisplay submission text.** Everything below
> documents a real App Review exchange for the **upstream OpenDisplay** app
> (submission ID, dates, and the linked demo video all belong to that submission).
> It's kept for context on how the "OpenSidecar → OpenDisplay" name issue was
> resolved. MeowDisplay is its own App Store Connect app (see
> `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`'s "Fork rebrand" note) and will need its **own** App
> Review Information, demo video, and Resolution Center replies if it hits a

Hello, and thank you for the detailed review.

We've addressed all three items in this updated version:

Guideline 5.2.5 (Intellectual Property): We have renamed the app from
"OpenSidecar" to "OpenDisplay". The term "Sidecar" has been removed from the
app name and from all metadata — subtitle, description, keywords, and screenshots.

Guideline 2.3.7 (Accurate Metadata): We have removed all references to price,
including the word "free", from the screenshots and from the app metadata.

Guideline 2.1 (Information Needed): OpenDisplay is a second-display client and
requires our free companion "OpenDisplay" Mac app to function. We have added
setup steps and the Mac app download link under App Review Information, and a
demo video recorded on a physical iPad showing the initial USB/Wi-Fi pairing
with the Mac app and the full workflow:

## App Review Information → Notes (paste into App Store Connect)

```
OpenDisplay turns an iPhone/iPad into a second display for a Mac. It is
non-functional on its own — it requires the free companion "OpenDisplay"
Mac app running on a Mac on the same USB cable or Wi-Fi network.

Mac app download (free, open source): https://peetzweg.github.io/opendisplay
1. Install and open OpenDisplay on a Mac.
2. Launch OpenDisplay on the iPhone/iPad.
3. Connect over USB (plug the device into the Mac) or Wi-Fi (same network).
4. The device appears as an extended display; drag windows onto it, use
   touch and two-finger scroll, rotate portrait/landscape.

Demo video (real device + pairing + full workflow): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyEUkMgH3zw
No account or login is required.
